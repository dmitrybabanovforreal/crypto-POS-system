This is a simple CLI POS system for an offline crypto exchange store. It does the following:
1. Helps to calculate the opposite sum of the transaction when a customer wants to convert to/from USD
2. Depending on the transaction, it presents on the screen the store's QR code with the respective crypto wallet or scans the customer's crypto wallet via webcam.
3. Stores the transaction data to Excel file

It accounts for the store's transaction fee, retrieves the current USD-crypto conversion rate and calculates the opposite amount.

You can specify both "from" and "to" amount of both types of conversion.
